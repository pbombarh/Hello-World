# Hello-World
This is my first time trying to learn to code. Also, my first repository
My name is Pablo and im 27 years old. This is my first time here, so im kind of lost for now. It is part of the learning curve i guess.
Mostly of my working experience is oriented to finance. I was a financial risk consultant in a big 4, before the COVID.

Im mostly interested in machine learning and automation of reports. 
Im from Santiago, Chile and i dont know what else can i put here. I guess thats it for now.
